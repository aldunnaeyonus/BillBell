Since our server does not (and should not) have your private encryption key, it cannot encrypt the data of these imported bills. They are stored as plain text initially. How to secure them: Once you open the app and your phone downloads the new imported bills, they will work normally. If you edit and save an imported bill, the app will automatically encrypt it using the key on your device, securing it from that point forward."},

If your new device's Public Key was not synchronized with the server before the latest key was generated, the app cannot decrypt the Family Key."},

What Rotation Does: This process generates a brand new key and re-encrypts that key specifically for every member using their latest Public Key on file. Your Action: After the Admin completes the rotation, fully close and relaunch the app on your problematic device. The app will download the new key and your bills will reappear. Note: If the issue persists after the Admin rotates the key, you may need to Log Out and Log In again to force a complete reset of your local device keys."}
